# Singa Converter Discord Bot

## THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED

I made this project in one night (probably like 5 - 8 hours) and I hate the code myself.
There are many improvements you can make, the code quality is low and I have no interest in fixing them.
All requests made to Singa are single-threaded since for my use case it wasn't worth the bit of extra effort.

## Extra Notes
  - This uses Singa's internal API which is both not documented, likely to change, and they probably don't like you using it.
  - I barely leverage caching and certainly not where it makes any meaningful difference. Retrieval will be slow.

This project is not made to run in a production environment and is just a fun little 'thing' :)
