This project is superseded by my Spring version which (as of writing) I maintain. You can find my spring-boot-starter-discord [here](https://github.com/ZakShearman/spring-boot-starter-discord).

# simple-discord (library)

Simple-discord is a library for Discord JDA which aims to make a lot of general tasks easier and more efficient out of the box.
The main contributer to the code is still Hyfe but this is listed under a different repo so it's not directly visible.

> How do I include the library with Maven?
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.ZakShearman</groupId>
    <artifactId>simple-discord</artifactId>
    <version>Tag</version>
</dependency>
  ```

> How do I include the library with Gradle?
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
	    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
dependencies {
         implementation 'com.github.ZakShearman:simple-discord:Tag'
}
```
